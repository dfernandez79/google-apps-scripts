# Google Apps Scripts

This repository collects some useful scripts for Google Apps.

There isn't an automated way to install scripts other than publishing an Add-On.
So to use many of these scripts you'll need to open the script editor of a document
and do a copy & paste of the source code.

* **image-synchronization**: takes all the images in a folder and inserts or
  updates them in the document.
